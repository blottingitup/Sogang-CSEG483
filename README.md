This repository contains the code submitted for **Introduction to GPU Programming (CSEG483)**.  
The main objective is to enhance the given base code.
Direct copy is not recommended, but taking reference to *whisk up* some code of your own will be just fine.  

**HW1: 1D Gaussian Filtering**
* Write a kernel function for 1D Gaussian filtering using a grid-stride loop.
* After issuing a dummy call, measure the average execution time of the kernel function over multiple iterations.
* Verify that both the host and kernel functions produce the same results.
* Experiment with variables that affect the overall performance, and provide a summary and analysis of the results.  

**HW2: 1D Gaussian Filtering with Wrap Condition**
* Write a kernel function for 1D Gaussian filtering using the wrap-around condition.
* Also write two additional kernel functions: one using shared memory and the other using a grid-stride loop.
* Use Nsight Compute to analyze register and shared memory usage, achieved warp occupancy and other metrics(L1, L2 cache hit rate, warp state statistics) relative to thread block dimensions.
